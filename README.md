Simplified model for the tool-part interaction in spring-in of L-shape composite laminates


# How to use the Abaqus model
1. Download all three files and put them in the same folder

2. Open CHILE_Curved_Part_3D.py, change work directory to your current folder

3. Change path of your subroutine file, that's the 'chile_addme.for' file

4. Run CHILE_Curved_Part_3D.py in Abaqus via 'File > Run script'

# How to use Matlab model
1. Download all the files and put them in the same folder

2.1 For AS4/8552 model, execute main file: process.m

2.2 For Eglass/polyester model, execute main file: main.m

3. All the material properties are stored in ReadData.m
