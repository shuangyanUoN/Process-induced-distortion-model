# How to use the Abaqus model
1. Download all three files and put them in the same folder
2. Open CHILE_Curved_Part_3D.py, change work directory to your current folder
3. Change path of your subroutine file, that's the 'chile_addme.for' file
4. Run CHILE_Curved_Part_3D.py in Abaqus via 'File > Run script'
5. The simulation results can be compared with the experimental findings presented here: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compositesa.2009.11.008 

# How to use Matlab model
1. Download all the files and put them in the same folder
2. For AS4/8552 model, execute main file: process.m
3. For E-glass/polyester model, execute main file: main.m
4. E-glass/polyester modelling results can be compared with the numerical predictions presented here: https://doi.org/10.1177/002199839202600502
